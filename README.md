## Phone Pointer

A simple phone orientation tracker. Lets you track the movement of your phone on a computer screen.



### `Concept`
Find a way to track the motion of a phone on a laptop screen, and display it to the user.

This is a simple enough concept but opens up the possibility of lots of small and simple apps. Ideally packaging this in a nicer way would make it reausable as a resource for other apps.


### `Use`
The app is deplyed on [Heroku](https://blooming-sands-99394.herokuapp.com/)

On a mobile device go to the [controller](https://blooming-sands-99394.herokuapp.com/controller.html) page


This will allow you to calibrate and play with the functionality.
